Allan Berry is an artist, developer, and librarian living in Chicago, IL. Currently he helps make the web for the [University of Illinois at Chicago Library](https://library.uic.edu/).

Allan is cutting this website from whole cloth, as time permits; two small children manage to monopolize his time at the moment.  Please forgive a certain... simplicity.  Thanks.
